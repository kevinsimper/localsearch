# Your own search engine

You don't use your browser for only searching anymore, you also type in commands for websites that you don't remember the URL for or the shortcode for it.

There is no reason why Google needs to be quried for that!

Everyone should have their own search engine!

It will ensure privacy by not making your queries leave your machine and make searching faster.

Any big search engine company learns a lot about you from your queries, you should protect that!

Big search engine companies shows you ads and you can not customize their looks easily.

Big Search Engines customizes the results and you can end up in a filter boble.

Big Search Engine don't allow giving priority to your favorite websites like Wikipedia or other sites alike.

Big Search Engine don't allow you to combine results from your email, contacts and web results easily.

It should be easier to analyze your own queries, something I looked at here: https://www.kevinsimper.dk/posts/how-to-download-all-your-google-search-queries
